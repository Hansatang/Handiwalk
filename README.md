# Handiwalk


Handiwalk is an application to help people with disabilities to know which places in Denmark they can easily access. 
It allows them to plan their trips and avoid choosing the unnaccesible ones for them. 
They can also see their track favourites and use realtime navigation to not get lost.

We think this kind of application is really important for society, 
because there is not enought consideration for disabled people who just want to go into the city and enjoy themselves. 
There is nothing more depressing than being caged inside a house and we want to give people in this situation posibility to spend some quality time.

Requirements:
