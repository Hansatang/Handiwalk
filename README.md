# Handiwalk


Handiwalk is an application to help people with disabilities to know which recreational paths they can take. 
It allows them to plan their trips and avoid choosing the unnaccesible ones for them. 
They can also see their track history and use realtime navigation to not get lost.

We think this kind of application is really important for society, 
because there is not enought consideration for disabled people who just want to go for a scenic walk and enjoy nature. 
There is nothing more depressing than being caged inside a house and we want to give people in this situation posibility to spend some quality time with the nature.

Requirements:

- [ ] 	As a registered user I want to be able to log in, so I can have access to the system.
- [ ]   As a user I want to see the recreational paths in my area, so I can plan my trip.
- [ ]   As a user I want to see the accesibility level of the paths, so that I choose ones that are possible for me to enjoy.
- [ ]   As a registered user I want to see the history of the paths that I have already been on, so I can choose new ones to explore.
- [ ]   As a user I want to see my position on the map, so I will not get lost.
